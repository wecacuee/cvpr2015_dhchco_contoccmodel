Reviewer 1
==========
* Formally define the problem (input -> output)
* Initialization results
* Normalization of equation (4)

Reviewer 2
==========

* Already there
* Should be fixed in rebuttal
* Section 4.1 : Fix it
* Section 4.2 : Fix it
* number of TPs: Fix
* Eq 19: Fix it
* 3D Objects: yes
* Experiment with adding depth to bbox experiments.
* Experiments with 3D bbox fitting on 3D point clouds.

Reviewer 3
==========

* Write rebuttal
* Same as reviewer 2
* Table 2: Think about it more.

Meeting with manmohan
=====================

Localization experiment
-----------------------
* 3D trajectories are from using GT bbox.
* 2D trajectories triangulate 2 frame non linear minimization.
* Use a size prior

Binary 0 1 occupancy
--------------------
* goodness of continuous. write 

Association baseline
--------------------
* baseline suggested is my method.

Localization as application
---------------------------

* formulation as flexible : localization as an application.

ellipsoidal is too simplisitic
------------------------------
* balance between complexity 

* Ground truth on cars in KITTI

Localization table 2
--------------------
* probably the emperical parameters were chosen to optimize for the last
row
