# What to convey?

Contributions: 
* Optics motivated 3D soft occlusion model.
* Unified occlusion handling for point tracks and detection scores 

Method:
* We can only observe a point if it is reflected and then gets transmitted
through space between the point and the camera.
* We model probability of reflection motivated by lambertian reflection model.
* We model probability of transmission motivated by Beer-Lambert law.
* We can use this general occlusion model in different applications. For
example, we can compute the association probability of point tracks to the
cars, especially when the point tracks lie on the overlapping region of
bounding boxes. We can also change our confidence on the bounding boxes using
the occlusion model.

Experiments and Results:
We evaluate our occlusion model in two applications (1) association of point
tracks to cars (2) localization
(1) For application to point tracks to car association we compare our method to state of art
motion segmentation baselines of Robust Algebraic Segmentation and Spectral
clustering with spatial affinity constraint. We found that occlusion models
result in better association.
(2) For application to localization we formulate the problem on a factor graph
and evaluate the localization accuracy with and without occlusion models. The
occlusion models result in slightly better localization.

Conclusion:
The take home message is the detailed physics inspired 3D occlusion model when
computation time is not a constraint.

# One minute
We propose a general optics motivated continuous 3D occlusion model that can
be used in varying applications such as point track associations, occlusion
dependent confidence in object detection scores, and object localization. 

We can only observe a point in 3D if it is reflected by a surface and the
light is transmitted through the intermediate space between the point and the
camera. Hence we model probability of observation as product of reflection and
transmission probability which we assume to be independent. Our  
reflection probability model is inspired by lambertian reflection model, while
our transmission probability model is inspired by Beer-Lambert law. 

We evaluate our occlusion model in two applications : point track to object
association and car localization on KITTI dataset. We find that our occlusion
model helps in increasing performance in both the applications.
