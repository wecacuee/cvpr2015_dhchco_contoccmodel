\paragraph{Occlusion handling}
Several works in object detection consider occlusion by training a detector on visible parts of the object \cite{Gao_etal_2011,Wu_Nevatia_2007}. In recent years, object detectors have also considered occlusion reasoning using 3D cues, often learned from a dataset of CAD models \cite{Pepik_etal_2012,Pepik_etal_2013,Xiang_Savarese_2013}. By necessity, such frameworks are often a discrete representation of occlusion behavior, for example, in the form of a collection of occlusion masks derived from object configurations discretized over viewpoint. In constrast to these works, our occlusion modeling is also fully 3D, but allows for a continuous representation. Further, to derive 3D information, we do not use CAD models, rather we derive a probabilistic formulation based on physical insights.
