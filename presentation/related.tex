  \cite{Geiger_etal_2012} 
  % used stereo imagery and a restricted lane model that
  % reduce vehicle localization to a 1-D search on the lane.

  \cite{Milan_etal_2014}
  % Use continuous occlusion model in multi-tracking framework but those are
  % just in 2D, our occlusion model is more principled and is in 3D.


  \cite{Wojek_etal_2013} 
  % did exactly same way but we have better occlusion model because our
  % occlusion models are continous.
